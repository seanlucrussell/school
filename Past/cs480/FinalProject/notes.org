* Near Future Ideas
** Classify more than one instrument
Issue is data collection- probably less samples for each combination, and must find combinations of everything (must I though? maybe it will for instance learn to recognize VIOLIN and NOISE, so that I only need a bunch of examples of violin with other sounds, and it will learn to ignore things not violin)
** Try using the current classifier on weird inputs
See what happens when the classifier gets used on inputs that do not contain any instruments, or instruments that I have not trained it on, or one of the instruments I have trained it on with background noise, or multiples of the instruments I have trained it on.
** Improve current classifier
Make the current classifier more adaptable and easy to add new instruments to by making it collect data from a directory. Also, improve accuracy to at least 90% for every instrument. Further, allow saving of classifier for use in the future. Also improve performance and experiment with alternative algorithms.
* Far Future Ideas
** Music streaming services
Things like pandora but better, because they could be fully automated.
*** Learn preferences of users
This will probably be easier. The users would listen to songs, and the program will create a database of user preferences. Then machine learning will be applied based solely off of what songs someone likes and doesn't like.
*** Learn attributes of music
The network will analyze the song and look for specific attributes. Users will then listen to music, and the program will gather data on what attributes the listener enjoys. Then, the network will be able to analyze new music that no one has ever heard before and guess whether a user will enjoy it.
* Life Map
** Finish college and internship
** Find work at robotics/ai company (maybe should work for medical type thing instead?)
** Get sponsored to go back to school for PhD
** This needs more thought
