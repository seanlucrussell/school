Sean Russell, Deter Assignment 3

memo.cgi was vulnerable to a pathname attack. In this memo I will describe the nature of this weakness and the method used to fix it.

When the memo.cgi script is run, it looks for input from the user on which memo they would like to view. The user can specify this themselves by typing the path to the desired memo in the URL of the memo system's webpage. However, our system does not check these inputs and makes no effort to ensure invalid files are not accessed. So, instead of putting the name of a memo in the URL, a user could for instance put /etc/shadow, and our system would provide it to them.

My proposed patch to prevent these attacks checks the inputs provided by the user. In the script, memos are only to be stored in the /home/ and the /root/ directories. If any other directory is supplied, the server will not provide the page. Further, to prevent the user from doing something along the lines of /root/../../../../../../etc/shadow to effectively go to the root directory, the server will not provide information on any pathname that includes "..".

The included files are the patched memo.cgi, with the fixed code around line 78, and exploit2.sh which takes advantage of the vulnerability in the old server to dump the /etc/shadow file.

To run the demo attack, execute exploit2.sh. It will dump the contents of the /etc/shadow file into a file named shadow.txt.

This breach is very serious. It is incredibly easy to gain access to the password files for the system, which can then be used to gain root access to the system. This patch is not perfect, as an attacker might be able to discover some method of getting around the regular expressions used to check the path name. Perhaps chrooting the webserver or at least this process would prevent the attackers from gaining access to any unnecessary files.
