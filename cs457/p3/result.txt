<!-- End of Who What Where Division -->
<p>
   <p>
This senior level undergraduate course covers principles of data communications, local area networks, communications protocols, TCP/IP, and the Internet. 
<P>
CS457 is now being offered in both the Fall and Spring semesters.  This course is also offered as an online course for distance learning students.
<P>
If you want to learn how the Internet and its applications work,
 you should take this class. Note, however, that it is not an easy class as there is a wide variety of material that will be covered.
 Typically there are three programming assignments, weekly homework, a midterm and final exam. 
All programming is done in C/C++, Python and GO, so make sure you are comfortable with these languages. If you don't know them, learn them NOW! There are lots of tutorials and videos on the web. Each Project will take between 10 and 50 hours to complete.   
   </p>
        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>

<!--
	<p style="color: red">What follows is taken from the CS 253 Fall 2015
		Syllabus - it will NEED modification.</p>
-->

	<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
	<!-- Start of the Prerequisites -->
	<div class="indented">
		<p>CS 370 with a C [2.0] or better.
			STAT 301 or STAT/ECE 303 or STAT/ERHS 307 or STAT 309 or STAT 315 or STAT 311 (all with a C [2.0] or better).
			CS 253 with a C [2.0] or better. </p>
	</div>

	<h3>Textbook</h3>
	<!-- Start of the Textbook Section -->
	<div class="indented">
		<p>
			Optional Textbook: Computer Networks, A Systems Approach; 5th Edition by Larry Peterson and Bruce Davie. You may use other versions, but make sure you get the homework assignments correct. Even though this textbook is optional, it is worth purchasing by anyone serious about networking.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Attendance</h3>
	<div class="indented">
	<p>Students are expected to attend lectures, where
	information will be given that is not available at any other place.
	Attendance at recitations is recorded and contributes to your grade.
	Students are expected to:
	<ul>
	<li>to be on time to class and stay until the class is complete, 
	<li>silence cell phones, </li>
	<li>to be alert and attentive,</li>
	<li>to participate in class meetings,</li>
	<li>to use laptops only for class purposes.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Excused absences are handled in accordance with 
	CSU policies. If you are ill please let us know right away. CSU requires 
	verifiable proof (e.g. a note from the health center) for students 
	who wish to not be penalized for missed classes and work.

	<p> We also do not want you to come to class ill. Makeup work will 
	need to be explicitly negotiated. The objectives include: getting 
	students to class; not spreading illness; and making 
	sure students who are ill receive appropriate treatment.
	The material in this course (including learning to come to class and 
	stay awake) is important. Excessive absences will impact your grade. 
	<br />

	<h3>Grading</h3>
	<!-- Start of the Grading Section -->
	<div class="indented">
		<p>Here are the formally graded elements of the course and associated
			weighting:</p>
		<div class="indented">
			<table border="4" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4" summary="Grading percentages">
				<tr>
					<th scope="col" align="left">Activity</th>
					<th scope="col" align="left">Weight</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Weekly Homeworks</td>
					<td>10 %</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Programming Projects</td>
					<td>40 %</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Midterm</td>
					<td>20 %</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Final Exam</td>
					<td>30 %</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
	</div>
<!--
		<h4>On-line Quizzes</h4>
		<div class="indented">
			<p>On-line quizzes are associated with every reading assignment, and
				are required. The quizzes are mostly yes/no or multiple choice
				questions about the reading assignment, and they are designed to be
				straightforward if you have done the reading. Even better, they are
				open book (but not open neighbor or open colleague, see below). All
				quizzes are administered through Canvas; you have 15 minutes to take
				a quiz and you may take a quiz only once. The quizzes become
				available after the lecture in which the reading is assigned, and
				must be completed BEFORE THE LECTURE for which the reading is due.
				Quizzes become unavailable 15 minutes before class starts. No
				"make-up" quizzes are given, and no quiz is dropped.
		
		</div>
-->

		<h4>Recitations</h4>
		<div class="indented">

			<p>Recitations will typically cover elements and fundamentals of Socket Programming. We will initially begin by introducing some basic UNIX concepts required for networking, a small makefile tutorial and a little overview of the GNU debugger. From then onwards we will cover socket programming and related material for homeworks and projects.</p>

		</div>

		<h4>Programming Projects</h4>
		<div class="indented">
			<p>
				There will be 3 programming projects. The grading policies related to the projects are mentioned on this page. The projects will primarily deal with socket programming. However, socket programming will only be the base technology used in each of the projects. On a high level, each project will represent a different problem.
				
				C and C++ are to be used as the language of coding with the exception of one small sub-project to be written in Python. 
				The projects will basically reflect topics taught in class.  Note: we may use the GO language for some of the projects, as well as the MININET emulation system.  The recitation sections will cover the needed tutorials.

		</div>

		<h3>Late and Makeup Policy</h3>
		<!-- Start of the Policies -->
		<div class="indented">
				<p>Midterms: Make-up exams are only given for extraordinary circumstances (e.g., illness, death of family member). Students must consult with the instructor as soon as possible, preferably before the start of the exam. Examination dates are listed in the syllabus; be aware of them and plan accordingly.</p>

				<p>Programming Projects: Programs are submitted electronically. Details of how this is done appears with the first assignment. Always check the progress page for due dates. The due date will include a day and time. The assignment will also specify a late acceptance period which will include a late penalty of 50%. After the late period, electronic submission is closed; students that have not submitted programs receive no points for the assignment.</p>

				<p>Homeworks: Homeworks must be submitted per the instructions in the assignment and are due at the beginning of class on Tuesdays. Handwritten and scanned is acceptable, but the handwriting must be legible. The instructors and TAs reserve the right to decide whether or not a paper is legible. Late homeworks may be turned in at beginning of class on Thursday, and are subject to a 50% late penalty.</p>

<!--
				Quizzes: Make-up quizzes are not given. In the case of extraordinary circumstances (e.g., illness, death of family member), the grade will be exempted. 
-->
<!--
			<p>Deadlines are deadlines. If you fail to take a quiz, do a
				recitation, hand in a programming assignment, or take a test/exam on
				time, you get no points for that element.</p>

			<p>There is one important class of exceptions to the rule above:
				unforeseeable emergencies. Examples might include severe illness,
				the death of a family member or close friend, a house fire, etc. In
				the case of an unforeseeable emergency, please talk to the
				instructor.

	<p>For questions, explanations, or to report violations, contact your instructor
	or appropriate department administrator. Mediation of violations will be conducted within the
	Department and may be referred to the CSU Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution Office.</p>
	<p>
	Colorado State University students should be familiar with the 
	<a href = "http://tilt.colostate.edu/integrity/honorpledge/">
	University Honor Pledge</a>.
	<p>
<!--
		<p>
			All students are expected to conduct themselves professionally. We,
			specifically the instructors and GTAs, assume you are familiar with
			the policies in the <a
				href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~info/student-info">student
				information sheet</a> for the department. This course will adhere to
			CSU's policies as explained at the <a
				href="http://www.conflictresolution.colostate.edu/academic-integrity">Academic
				Integrity website</a> and the <a
				href="http://www.conflictresolution.colostate.edu/conduct-code">Student
				Conduct Code</a>. At a minimum, violations will result in a grading
			penalty in this course and a report to the Office of Conflict
			Resolution and Student Conduct Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, you are computing professionals. You should be familiar
			with the code of conduct for the primary professional society, ACM.
			You can read the ACM Code of Conduct <a
				href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~howe/acm-code.html">HERE</a>.
		</p>

		<p>We work to maintain an environment supportive of learning in the
			classroom and laboratory. Towards that end, we require that you be
			courteous to and respectful of your fellow participants (i.e.,
			classmates, instructors, GTAs and any tutors). In particular:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Please turn off the ring on your cell phone. If you are expecting
				an emergency call, sit near the door and slide out discretely to
				take it.</li>
			<li>In class use of electronic devices in general, and laptops
				specifically, is permitted as a courtesy so that you may better
				participate and learn. If at any time the instructor judges that
				your use of an electronic device is becoming a distraction to
				others, you may be asked to to turn it off and put it away.</li>
			<li>All exams and quizzes are to be done without the aid of notes of
				any kind. Laptops and all other electronic devices must be shut and
				put away during exams and quizzes.</li>
			<li>University labs (including but not limited to CSB 120) are
				professional, not personal, spaces. We expect professional behavior
				in these labs at all times.
		
		</ul>

	<h3>Discussion Boards (added 10/02/15 Ross)</h3>
	<div class="indented">
		<p>
			A class discussion board is being used to support this course. In
			particular, the discussion board is hosted at <a
				href="https://piazza.com/class/idrsj19wjbr3vz">Piazza</a>. All
			normal expectations regarding professional conduct apply to the
			discussion board. In addition, here are some explicit guidelines to
			assist in establishing the tone and expectations regarding the use of
			Piazza.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>No posting of any code for assignments.</li>
			<li>No inappropriate postings: e.g. profanity, sexism, racism,
				bullying, inflammatory remarks, bad taste.</li>
			<li>No grade inquiries: make those directly to the instructors.</li>
			<li>All students are expected to follow the discussions.</li>
			<li>Instructor posts, like in-class announcments, may clarify and
				even alter assignment specifications.</li>
			<li>Use the existing topics. Please don't start new threads.</li>
			<li>Only answer questions by other students when you are confident
				you are both correct and able to craft a helpful explanation.</li>
			<li>Questions may of course relate to how best to use tools.</li>
			<li>Do not expect instant answers. While answers may often come
				faster, a 24 hour response cycle is reasonable.</li>
			<li>Posts are anonymous one student to another through the Piazza
				interface.</li>
			<li>Posts are archival and individualized for the instructors.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This last item deserves additional comment. Please, keep in mind
			every word you type may be retained and shared by the instructor with
			others when the instructor determines there is good reason to do so.
			This should not concern you. It is the nature of a public discussion
			board that what you type is archival and public. However,
			understanding the public and personally identifiable nature of the
			discussion board should help reinforce the comments above about the
			importance of Professionalism.</p>
