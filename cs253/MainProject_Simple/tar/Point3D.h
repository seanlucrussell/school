/*! 
  Point3D is the base class for storing points in 3 space and accessing their coordinates. The
  PoseDisplay class will write out and display vectors of 25 Point3Ds (obviously, their order matters!).
  
  The Point3D class as implemented here is sufficient for Programming Assignment #1. As the semester
  progresses, however, students are encouraged to extend this class by adding new methods, new overloaded
  operators, and new data fields as necessary. As long as the X(), Y(), Z() methods and the << operator
  below are retained, the PoseDisplay class will work with modifications of the Pose3D class. Students
  are also encouraged new classes, including classes that might contain Point3D fields.
