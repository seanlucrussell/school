All values keep track of references to them and free automatically
All values are const

Variables point to values
Variables can change, the values they point to don't
If a variable changes, it makes a copy of the underlying values and modifies those
This means that all variables are passed by reference

x(a,b) = a + b

x(1,2)
x('hey ','friend')


if 0 <= a < b:
   a++


any function that changes any of its arguments must be prefaced by ! (compiler will check if any ! appears in the function and will throw errors if one appears in the function but not the function name)
